# Algerian-Arabic-stop-words update 01.21
In addition to the MSA stop-words, Algerian Arabic diclect (AA) ones are added in this work.
Stop-words come from multipe transcribed speech corpora (journalistic speech, spontanious speech, code-swthced speech). Phonetic variation is not taken into account.
However, since Algerian Arabic is a low resourced langague, it's possible to find in the list a same word with different spellings (in reference to professional human transcribers)
MSA and AA stop-words has been merged together beacause of the hight use of MSA in AA speech (citations, code-switching, MSA borrowings ...)
